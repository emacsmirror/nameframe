* Nameframe

Nameframe provides utility functions to manage frames by their names.

It's primary goal is to be used with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]. When opening a Projectile
project, it will either switch to an existing frame of the project, or
create a new frame for the project.

** Installation

*** Manual install

Copy ~nameframe.el~ and ~nameframe-projectile.el~ into your Emacs load path
and add the following line to your init file (make sure you have Projectile installed):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'nameframe-projectile)
#+END_SRC

** Caveats

- Only tested on GUI Emacs 24.5 (on OS X, but should work with other GUI versions)
- Does not work with Helm
