* Nameframe

Nameframe provides utility functions to manage frames by their names.

It's primary goal is to be used with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] and/or perspective.el. When opening a Projectile
project, it will either switch to an existing frame of the project, or
create a new frame for the project.

** Installation

*** MELPA

Nameframe will be available on MELPA Soonâ„¢. (See issue #4)

For the meantime, please follow the manual install steps below.

*** Manual install

Copy ~nameframe.el~ into your Emacs load path.

Optionally, copy ~nameframe-projectile.el~ and ~nameframe-perspective.el~
into your load path as well. See *Usage* section below for details.

** Usage

*** Vanilla

- ~nameframe-switch-frame~ - Interactive function to switch between existing frames by name.
You may want to bind this to a key. e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)
#+END_SRC

- ~nameframe-create-frame~ - Interactive function to create a new frame.

*** Projectile

Nameframe provides Projectile integration to open projects in their
own frames. To enable Projectile integration, add the following line to your
init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nameframe-projectile-mode)
#+END_SRC

This will override Projectile's ~projectile-switch-project~ mapping (mapped to =C-c p p= by default) to open projects in frames.

*** Perspective

Nameframe also provides ~perspective.el~ integration, so each frame has its own
perspective (and thus have its own list of buffers).

To enable perspective integration, add the following line to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nameframe-perspective-mode t)
#+END_SRC

With perspective integration enabled, calling ~nameframe-create-frame~ will now
create a perspective.

*** Recommended setup

Although the Projectile and ~perspective.el~ integrations are optional, nameframe
really shines when used in conjunction with both packages. Here is a snippet on how to
use nameframe to its full potential:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Assuming Projectile and perspective.el are already installed

(projectile-global-mode)
(persp-mode)

(nameframe-projectile-mode t)
(nameframe-perspective-mode t)

;; shortcut to switch between existing frames by name
;; specify your own key (or use your OS's window switching)
(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)

#+END_SRC

With this setup, switching to a project will open it in its own dedicated
frame with isolated buffers.

** Caveats

- Only (thoroughly) tested on GUI Emacs 24.5 on OS X
  - but seems to work fine on terminal Emacs
- Does not work with Helm (I personally don't use Helm. Pull-requests welcome.)
