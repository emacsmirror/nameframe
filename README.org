* Nameframe

Nameframe provides utility functions to manage frames by their names.

It's primary goal is to be used with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]. When opening a Projectile
project, it will either switch to an existing frame of the project, or
create a new frame for the project.

** Installation

*** Manual install

Copy ~nameframe.el~ into your Emacs load path.

Optionally, copy ~nameframe-projectile.el~ and ~nameframe-perspective.el~
into your load path as well. See **Usage** section below for details.

** Usage

*** Vanilla

- ~nameframe-switch-frame~ - Interactive function to switch between existing frames by name.
You may want to bind this to a key. e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)
#+END_SRC

- ~nameframe-create-frame~ - Interactive function to create a new frame.

*** Projectile

Nameframe provides Projectile integration to open projects in their
own frames. To enable Projectile integration, add the following line to your
init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'nameframe-projectile)
#+END_SRC

This will override Projectile's =C-c p p= mapping to open projects in frames.

To map to a different key instead, replace this line in ~nameframe-projectile.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key projectile-mode-map [remap projectile-switch-project] 'nameframe-projectile-switch-project)
#+END_SRC

*** Perspective

Nameframe also provides ~perspective.el~ integration, so each frame has its own
perspective (and thus have its own list of buffers).

To enable perspective integration, add the following line to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'nameframe-perspective)
#+END_SRC

*** Recommended setup

Although the Projectile and ~perspective.el~ integrations are optional, nameframe
really shines when used in conjunction with both packages. Here is a snippet on how to
use nameframe to its full potential:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Assuming Projectile and perspective.el are already installed;
;; And nameframe.el, nameframe-projectile.el, and nameframe-perspective.el
;; are all in the load path

(projectile-global-mode)
(persp-mode)

(require 'nameframe)
(require 'nameframe-projectile)
(require 'nameframe-perspective)

(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)

#+END_SRC

** Caveats

- Only tested on GUI Emacs 24.5 (on OS X, but should work with other GUI versions)
- Does not work with Helm (I personally don't use Helm. Pull-requests welcome.)
