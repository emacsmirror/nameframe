* Nameframe

Nameframe provides utility functions to manage frames by their names.

It's primary goal is to be used with [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]]. When opening a Projectile
project, it will either switch to an existing frame of the project, or
create a new frame for the project.

** Installation

*** Manual install

Copy ~nameframe.el~ into your Emacs load path.

If you are using Projectile, then you will want to add ~nameframe-projectile.el~ into
your Emacs load path as well and add the following line to your init file
(make sure you have Projectile installed):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'nameframe-projectile)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

~nameframe-switch-frame~ - Interactive function to switch between existing frames by name.
You may want to bind this to a key. e.g.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "M-P") 'nameframe-switch-frame)
#+END_SRC

*** Projectile

Once ~nameframe-projectile~ is required, it will override Projectile's
=C-c p p= mapping to open projects in frames.

To map to a different key instead, replace this line in ~nameframe-projectile.el~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key projectile-mode-map [remap projectile-switch-project] 'nameframe-projectile-switch-project)
#+END_SRC


** Caveats

- Only tested on GUI Emacs 24.5 (on OS X, but should work with other GUI versions)
- Does not work with Helm
